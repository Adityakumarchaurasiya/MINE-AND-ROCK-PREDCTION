# ⛏️ Mine and Rock Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a **Machine Learning classification model** that predicts whether a given object is a **mine** or a **rock** based on sonar signal data.  
It is implemented in **Python** using libraries such as **NumPy** and **Pandas** for data processing and **Scikit-learn** for model building.

## 📖 About the Project
This project is inspired by the need to classify sonar signals received from underwater objects into **two categories**:
- **Mine**: Potentially dangerous explosive devices
- **Rock**: Harmless natural underwater rocks

The prediction is made by training a **supervised classification model** on labeled sonar data.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the **Sonar Mines vs Rocks dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
Each sample contains **60 numerical features** representing sonar signal strength at different frequencies, and a label indicating:
- `M` → Mine  
- `R` → Rock

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** → Numerical computation
- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn** → Model building and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional) → Interactive coding environment

---

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Import Libraries**: Load NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
2. **Load Dataset**: Read the sonar dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Check for missing values.
   - Encode categorical labels (`M` → 1, `R` → 0).
   - Split dataset into **features** and **labels**.
4. **Train-Test Split**: Divide data into training and testing sets.
5. **Model Training**: Use a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest).
6. **Model Evaluation**: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Prediction**: Test with sample inputs.
